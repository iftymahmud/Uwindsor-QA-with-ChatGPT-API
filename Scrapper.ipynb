      "When new alumni leave the University of Windsor campus to pursue the next chapter in their lives, they not only take with them the accomplishment of earning a degree, but they also take treasured memories of campus life, and friendships that will last a lifetime.\n",
      "It is this unique sense of a collegiate community, of a time when students have life-changing opportunities and they establish a special ‘sense of place’ that can be found within the pages of this new photo book.\n",
      " \n",
      "This is a feeling that the University of Windsor Alumni Association knows very well and as a result, they have sponsored the entire cost of the photo book so that all of the proceeds will go toward student scholarships.\n",
      "Through Richard Bain’s lens, this book captures the last two years of campus life. But it captures so much more than that. It is a reminder of the unique characteristics and characters that bring this campus to life. It is a yearbook for our very recent past, but it is also a yearbook for all of our alumni, our faculty, our staff, our community partners and our neighbours — for all Lancers who have a shared history on this campus.\n",
      "They say a picture says a thousand words, and each one captured in this book helps tell the story of the University of Windsor’s vibrant campus community. Together with the contributions of a few of distinguished authors, we are pleased to present this keepsake of campus life during the University of Windsor’s 50th Anniversary in 2013.\n",

      " \n",
      "The University of Windsor Lancer men and the University of Guelph Gryphon women were crowned the 2014 OUA track and field champions on Saturday evening (Feb. 22) at the Toronto Track and Field Centre.\n",
      " \n",
      "The Lancers re-claimed the men's banner, which is their 15th in the last 16 seasons. They finished the meet with 158 points, which was only five better than the Gryphons and 21 better than the host, Lions.\n",
      " \n",
      "The Gryphons women's team have now won back-to-back banners and claimed it with a score of 150.5 points, 14.5 points ahead of second-place Toronto Varsity Blues and Western Mustangs. The Lancers finished fourth with 101.5 points; while the host, York Lions rounded out the top five teams with 69.\n",
      " \n",
      "The Lancers were led to victory largely by the efforts of Alex Ullman who struck gold in the 600m with a time of 1:20.48. He capped off the day by running anchor for a come-from-behind victory in the 4x400m relay, where the top three teams all broke the previous OUA meet mark. Their time of 3:17.24 now stands as the best time in the OUA championships, a record previously held by the Mustangs from 1993. Brandon Wilhelm also found the top of the podium, as his jump of 2.04m was good for gold in the high jump.\n",
      " \n",
      "On the women's side, the Gryphons got out to an early start on day two as Sarah Dougherty won the weight throw with a distance of 17.22m. Shortly after, Katelyn Ayers won the 600m gold medal with a time of 1:31.92, which was her second gold of the championships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lancer women had another strong day of competition and finished fourth overall with 101.5 points, behind Guelph, Toronto and Western. Please see below for a complete list of medalists, and click here to view the complete championship results.\n",
      " \n",
      "Another meet record fell on the second day of competition as York's Khamica Bingham lowered the 60m mark she set last year to a blazing-fast 7.23 seconds. Another record was nearly set in the men's 60m race with York's Dontae Richards-Kwok tying the 6.66 seconds initially put up by former York runner Desai Williams in 1983.\n",
      " \n",
      "Their gold medals in the 60m were two of the six the Lions won on Saturday. Eric Brathwaite won his second gold of the weekend, this time in the shot put with a toss of 17.28m, finishing just ahead of teammate Umar Khan, who picked up the silver. Also in the field events, David McKay won his third straight title in the pole vault with a top height of 4.91m, and Richard Jansen finished in first place in the triple jump with a distance of 14.46m.\n",
      " \n",
      "Rounding out the hosts gold medals was the women's 4x200m relay team, which finished atop the podium with a time of 1:39.95, the fastest mark in the CIS this season.\n",
      " \n",
      "The Varsity Blues were also busy on the top of the podium striking gold in the high jump (Katia Vasilyeva, 1.72m), 1500m (Gabriela Stafford, 4:28.71), and the women's 4x400m relay (3:45.50).\n",
      " \n",
      "The Gryphons won gold in the men's 4x200m relay with a time of 1:29.01, edging out the Lions who were 16 tenths of a second behind. Adding to the Gryphons' gold medal count was Ross Proudooft who ran 3:49.56 in the 1500m.\n",
      " \n",
      "Rounding out the OUA champions on Saturday was Caroline Ehrhardt of the Mustangs who won the triple jump with a leap of 12.83m, which was her second gold medal of the championships.\n",
      " \n",
      "In addition to the hardware won at the OUA championships, the top two finishers from each event, as well as all student-athletes who surpassed the automatic standards, have qualified for the CIS championships, which will take place March 6-8 at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.\n",

      "Windsor tops Gaels 73-48, claims fifth OUA title\n",
      "Box Score WINDSOR, Ont.- The Windsor Lancers women's basketball team claimed its second-straight conference banner on Saturday evening at the St. Denis Centre, defeating the Queen's Gaels 73-48 in the OUA Final, presented by ArcelorMittal Dofasco.\n",
      "\n",
      "Windsor claims its fifth OUA title in the last six seasons, and joins Toronto and Laurentian as the only women's basketball programs to have claimed at least five Ontario conference championships since it was first awarded in 1971-72. The Lancers improve their OUA Final record to 5-1 over the last six years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miah-Marie Langlois recorded a game-high 25 points and tallied eight assists, six rebounds and two steals, earning herself the Porter Airlines player of the game honour. Jessica Clemencon scored 21 points and added eight rebounds for Windsor, who extends its playoff winning streak to 12 games. Korissa Williams tallied 14 points and rookie Cheyanne Roger grabbed a game-high 10 rebounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Veterans Liz Boag and Jenny Wright each scored a team-best 17 points for the Gaels who last won the conference title in the 2000-01 season. Queen's joins Windsor at the St. Denis Centre next weekend for the CIS Final 8 national championships, as will the Laurier Golden Hawks who earned the final OUA berth by defeating Carleton in double-overtime in the bronze medal match earlier on Saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lancers jumped out to a 9-0 lead in the opening quarter. After a slow start in the first two minutes, Williams notched back-to-back transition lay-ups off a pair of Gaels turnovers. Langlois then went to work, as the OUA defensive player of the year followed a running jumper down the middle with a baseline fade-away. Another mid-range jumper from the Windsor native gave the women a commanding 17-3 lead at the 3:30 point of the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Williams made good on another transition basket on a fast-break outlet from Kristine Lalonde. Clemencon nailed a deep two at the buzzer, and led all players with eight first-quarter points as Windsor took a 23-7 lead into the second.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gaels offence came alive early in the second, as Wright's three-pointer helped the visitors go on a mini run. The Kingston, Ont. native then picked up two more points on a strong drive to the basket while being fouled and converted her ensuing free-throw to cap off an 8-2 run.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Clemencon continued her potent perimeter shooting, knocking down two more jumpers to stem the Gaels tide. Boag picked up her first three-pointer of the game, but Langlois responded with two more baskets of her own to keep Windsor's offence rolling through the first half.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boag followed another three with a lay-up, but Clemencon responded with a basket and foul shot. The St. Rambert, France native polished off an impressive first half with a jumper on Windsor's final second quarter possession, as Windsor took a 43-27 lead into the locker rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clemencon finished the half with 19 points, as the Lancers shot just under 53% from the field. Queen's was led by Boag's 12 points and worked at a 34.6% efficiency.\n",
      "Windsor used a 10-2 run through the first five minutes of the third quarter to extend its lead. Langlois polished off the Lancers streak with two speedy penetrations inside to put the home team up 24. The offense slowed for both squads in the second part of the third, as the teams combined for just 18 points in the quarter, and the Lancers maintained a 20-point advantage heading into the final period.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three-time defending CIS champions only padded their lead in the final 10 minutes of play to earn their second conference championship in as many years, and will look to add a fourth straight national title to their trophy case next weekend at the St. Denis Centre. Windsor shot 42.3% in the championship, compared to 31.6% from the Gaels. The Lancers also won the glass battle, totalling 52 boards to 33 from Queen's.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CIS Final 8 begins next Friday, March 14 at the St. Denis Centre. Stay tuned to GoLancers.ca for all championship schedule updates.\n",

      "Fueling the curiosity of Canadian youth through STEM projects\n",
      "Established in 1966, Youth Science Canada fuels the curiosity of Canadian youth through science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) projects. We work to ensure that Canadian youth have the capacity and skills to generate and answer questions and identify and solve problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this end, we help provide various opportunities for interested youth to get involved in exciting and imaginative inquiry and project-based science. More than 8,000 dedicated volunteers nationwide help us to achieve this. And thanks to these combined efforts, every year in Canada, more than 500,000 bright, inquisitive minds get involved in project-based science — about the same number of Canadian youth as are registered in minor hockey. These young STEM enthusiasts are Canada’s next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs.\n",

      "Being an artist in Windsor is to experience the best in creative culture, says Susan Gold, a practicing artist and professor emeritus of visual arts at the University of Windsor.\n",
      "The community provides a critical mass of support for artists, helping them to develop and encouraging cross-fertilization between disciplines, genres, and values.\n",
      "The only thing better than to be an artist is to be a patron of the arts and enjoy the many strands of Windsor's rich cultural tapestry.\n",
      "School of Creative Arts\n",
      "The new School of Creative Arts (SoCA) downtown campus is home to the Visual Arts and VABE programs and includes a SoCA Projects Gallery and VABE Projects Display.\n",

      "The Art Gallery of Windsor collects, conserves, interprets, and presents Canadian art. Its riverfront building in downtown Windsor is a place to view significant works of art by local, regional, and national artists. The gallery's collection of more than 3,000 works of art—including paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, sculptures, illustrations, and videos—covers the period from about 1750 through to the present day.\n",
      "The Arts Council - Windsor & Region is an umbrella organization representing and promoting all artistic endeavour within Windsor and Essex County. It operates the Artspeak Gallery in the heart of Olde Walkerville, as well as ArtsNotes, one of Windsor’s most comprehensive events listings.\n",
      "Artcite artist-run centre maintains a balanced and perse program of visual art exhibitions and events, including performance, film and video screenings, artists' lectures and workshops, and presentations of experimental music and interdisciplinary art production by local, regional, national and international artists. It is located in a store front of the Capitol Theatre and Arts Centre in Windsor's downtown core.\n",
      "Common Ground is an unjuried exhibition space available to all interested self-motivated artists. It is located about one-half kilometre west of the UWindsor campus, in the Mackenzie Hall Cultural Centre.\n",
      "The Windsor Sculpture Park is a museum without walls, a unique showcase of more than 30 large-scale, internationally-recognized works of contemporary sculpture on the shores of the Detroit River, stretching from the University of Windsor campus to the Art Gallery of Windsor.\n",
      "Both the city and the county are home to commercial galleries, with particular concentration in Windsor's downtown core, Walkerville, and Riverside.\n",

      "Mitch Farrell led all scorers with 27 points on 10-14 shooting and 7 of 9 from three point range.\n",
      "Windsor, ON - The Windsor Lancers men's basketball team earned an impressive 89-74 victory over the Indiana Purdue at Fort Wayne Mastodons in their annual OUA-NCAA Tip-Off Classic on Wednesday night at the St. Denis Centre.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the fourth straight year that Head Coach Chris Oliver's squad has earned a pre-season victory over an NCAA Division I opponent. The Lancers previously earned wins over Oakland University, University of South Alabama, and The Citadel.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Lancers, guard Mitch Farrell turned in an electric performance in his Windsor debut as he led all scorers with 27 points on 10-14 shooting including an incredible 7 of 9 from three-point range. He also added 5 assists, 3 rebounds and 2 steals to help pace the Lancer victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday night, Windsor jumped out to an early four point advantage and then went back and forth with the Mastodons through much of the first quarter. Senior Evan Matthews provided an early spark in the low post as the two teams were tied 20-20 after the opening ten minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second quarter, the Lancers again opened up a slight lead but weren't able to break free of the Mastodons. Another evenly played quarter ended with IPFW holding a slim 42-40 lead at halftime.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second half was all Windsor as the home team exploded early in the third quarter and built a ten point advantage. Veterans Rotimi Osuntola Jr. and Khalid Abdel-Gabar connected from long-range as the Lancers extended to a commanding 66-52 lead. The Lancers were on fire from behind the arc throughout the contest and finished 17-34 from three-point range.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mastodons were unable to mount a charge in the fourth quarter as Farrell and Alex Campbell hit from deep to increase the Lancer lead as they cruised to the 89-74 win.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to Farrell's 27 points, the new look Lancers also got 17 points and 7 rebounds from Rotimi Osuntola Jr. and 15 points from Khalid Abdel-Gabar. Alex Campbell chipped in with 12 points and Evan Matthews added 9 points and 6 rebounds while playing some tremendous low post defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lancers next pre-season action will take place on September 20th when they host Humber College at 4pm at the St. Denis Centre.\n",

      "OUA champs open season against Guelph\n",
      "After claiming their first Queen's Cup Championship in 16 years, the 2014-15 Windsor Lancers men's hockey team is set to make another run for the Queen's Cup title and a second consecutive appearance in the CIS University Cup championship.\n",
      " \n",
      "The Lancers will kick-off the season this Wednesday when they take on the Guelph Gryphons in their season opener at 7:30pm at South Windsor Arena.\n",
      " \n",
      "The Lancers first OUA banner since the 1997-98 season didn't come easy, as their opponents from McGill put together a substantial late third period run after going down by three goals, and nearly sent the game into overtime with under a minute remaining in regulation.\n",
      " \n",
      "However, an incredible 50-save performance by Queen's Cup player of the game Parker Van Buskirk and a two-goal outburst in the second period of play proved to be enough for the Lancers to win their second OUA banner in their last three trips to the Queen's Cup Final.\n",
      " \n",
      "Few had predicted Windsor's run at the outset of the post-season, as the Lancers came into the playoffs ranked fourth in the OUA West division with a 17-11-0 record but had played .500 hockey throughout the second-half of the season. However, after earning a victory over the bitter rival and top-seeded Western Mustangs in the division semi-finals where Windsor came back from one-game down to win the best-of-three, it was full-steam ahead for the Lancer men. They dominated the division finals against Lakehead, another higher seed in the West, winning the series by a combined score of 13-3 in two-straight games.\n",
      " \n",
      "The outlook for 2014-15 is a positive one for the Lancers, as they are returning their top two point producers from last year Spencer Pommells and captain Drew Palmer. Pommells tallied over 30 points for the second straight year notching 32 points to lead the Lancers while Palmer notched 17 assists and recording 25 points.\n",
      " \n",
      "Kenny Bradford led all Lancer blue-liners with 15 points, including 10 goals. Goaltender Parker Van Buskirk, entering his final year of eligibility, will look to build from his success from last season where he garnered a 2.66 goals-against average and .920 save percentage to go along with 16 wins in the regular season.\n",
      " \n",
      "The Lancers will not be without a couple of significant losses this year, as former OUA all-star Evan Stibbard and prominent forward Derek Lanoue graduated following last season. Fifth year defenseman Christian Steingraber also completed his education, leaving holes at both the front and back of the line-up.\n",
      " \n",
      "Head coach Kevin Hamlin hopes to begin filling those voids with his 2014-15 recruiting class, which includes LaSalle Vipers captain Dylan Denomme. This past season, the Windsor, ON native was named a western conference all-star, was a nominee for league MVP, and putt up career best 37 goals to go along with 72 points in 39 games. He also became the franchise's all-time leading goal scorer, ending his career with 113 goals.\n",
      " \n",
      "The Lancers and Gryphons will open the season at South Windsor Arena this Wednesday night, with puck-drop set for 7:30 p.m. Fans will receive a commemorative 2014 Queen's Cup Championship team poster and also have the chance to take their photo with the second oldest trophy in history, the Queen's Cup. Season tickets will also be available at the gate for only $50. \n",

      "If music is the heartbeat of a city, Windsor has a pulse all its own. \n",
      "The University boasts an active performance program with concerts and recitals by students and faculty members both on- and off-campus. The School of Creative Arts (SoCA) organizes a wind ensemble, a jazz ensemble, and a percussion ensemble, as well as several vocal groups—including the Women’s Chamber Choir, national winner in its category of the 2008 CBC Radio choir competition.\n",
      "  Many of the university’s music instructors perform professionally with the Windsor Symphony Orchestra, whose musical excellence has earned a number of awards and accolades—most recently a Juno nomination for its recording of Peter and the Wolf and Last Minute Lulu, a new work with music composed by music professor Brent Lee.\n",
      "  Among the other important contributors to Windsor’s music scene are\n",
      "the Windsor Folk Music & Arts Society, which sponsors a series of concerts and open-mic events\n",
      "the Carrousel of Nations, a celebration of the region’s cultural diversity\n",
      "Caesars Windsor\n",
      "Windsor’s nightlife is renowned for its vibrant downtown, home to many dance clubs. However, the city provides opportunities to hear live music too, from the WFCU Centre, a 6900-seat concert and entertainment venue to the St. Clair Centre for the Arts with its spectacular views of the Detroit skyline; from Caesar’s Windsor, which books headline acts from around the world to intimate café spaces like the 60-seat Phog Lounge—whose indie line-up earned it the title \"best live music club in Canada\" in a nationwide poll on CBC Radio 3.\n",
      "  And no discussion of Windsor’s music scene would be complete without mentioning the benefits afforded by proximity to Detroit. The Motor City gave rise to the Motown and techno sounds, and has produced artists as varied as Madonna and Eminem, Aretha Franklin and the White Stripes, Bob Seger and Ted Nugent.\n",
      "  The city is home to the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and the Detroit Opera House. Its theatres and concert halls—including the Fisher, the Fox, the Masonic Temple, the Fillmore Detroit, the Music Hall Centre for the Performing Arts, and Saint Andrews Hall—make it a destination for every major music tour.\n",

Take a bus into downtown for a bite at a cool new restaurant. Grab some friends and catch a show at dozens of live music venues, bars and cafes. \n",

      "Dozens of University of Windsor retirees, friends and supporters filled the reception room at Canterbury College on Friday afternoon to celebrate the official launch of Back in the Day—1963-2013: The University of Windsor As We Knew It. The book represents the collected memories of 70 retired faculty members, senior administrators and librarians, who shared their unique perspective on the development of the University of Windsor during its first 50 years.\n",
      "The volume, edited by Drs. Kate McCrone, Sheila Cameron, Ralph Johnson, Kenneth Pryke and Lois Smedick, features stories of the University’s heady early days, when newly recruited faculty members found their feet and their careers in Windsor. Anecdotes include poignant stories of teaching exceptional students; tales of engineering student hijinks; and a faculty member’s first amazing encounter with a personal computer, to name a few.\n",
      "“We treasure our University memories and associations,” Dr. McCrone said, thanking contributors for their efforts to bring the book to print. “It feels very special to have people of this volume representing the University in this way—after all the University is all about the people. This book is our gift to the University of Windsor on the occasion of its 50th birthday.”\n",
      "Copies of Back in the Day are available for purchase at the University of Windsor bookstore.\n",

      "To successfully reinforce a consistent brand, it is important that the University of Windsor logo is presented accurately when used.\n",
      "Under no circumstances should any component of the logo ever be redrawn, modified or altered in any way.\n",

      "The University of Windsor approved fonts for print materials are DIN and Amasis.\n",
      "Secondary fonts for limited uses include DIN Condensed (advertising materials), Tahoma, and Georgia (web).\n",
      "Primary typeface: DIN\n",
      "DIN is a realist sans-serif typeface that was widely used for traffic, administrative and technical applications. It was defined by the German standards body DIN - Deutsches Institut für Normung (German Institute for Standardization) in the standard sheet DIN 1451-Schriften (typefaces) in 1931.\n",
      "The popularity of the typeface grew beyond this original context because it (unintentionally) embodied many of the ideological principles in play in Europe at the time – Realism and Modernism in particular – which attempted to scrape away as much of the cultural references and adornments in as many things as possible.\n",
      "Now DIN is being used all over the world in a wide variety of contexts. It is celebrated for being clean, modern, bold, and striking–it looks contemporary and feels strong. It is straight-forward and “tells the truth.” Its impersonal and neutral character allows it to be a typographic backbone, letting everything else in the design and layout do the talking.\n",
      "Primary typeface: Amasis\n",
      "Amasis is a slab serif design which has been drawn with a humanist approach, rather than the traditional geometric construction associated with this style of letter. The result is a typeface that has an affinity with classical design, although in character it belongs to the latter decades of the twentieth century. The Amasis italic fonts, rather than being sloped roman or cursive in nature, are related more to the Old Style italics. Amasis works particularly well in small sizes where readability is important.\n",

      "The University of Windsor has developed a broad range of student exchange partnerships with other universities and post-secondary institutions around the world.\n",
      "Currently we have 25 exchange programs in 13 countries, involving over 40 different partner institutions.\n",
      "Students who participate in these exchanges invariably report that it is the single most valuable part of their university experience.\n",
      "Normally, students go on exchange for one or two semesters after completing four or more semesters of study at the University of Windsor. No tuition is charged by the partner institution; students continue to pay their University of Windsor tuition while they are away. Some financial assistance is also available.\n",
      "All course credits obtained on exchange may be applied to the University of Windsor degree requirements as appropriate.\n",
      "While some exchanges allow students to take their courses in English, students are particularly encouraged to consider exchanges which will promote second-language competence. In these cases, students should prepare by enroling in relevant language courses at the University of Windsor from the time they begin their studies here.\n",
      "Read more about student exchange, including a list of current partnership destinations.\n",
